# License

I dont get paid at all to suffer 4am in the morning fixing mods that aren't mine. So if you actually care, check each respective repo/website for the license...

- VRM + VRMShaders stuff: MIT I think
- UnityAsyncImageLoader: Check Midnight's repo
- Unity.Burst.dll + Unity.Mathematics.dll: Unity licance
