# Issue Tracking

If I ask you to investigate an error, first check to see if a previous document of it already exists in the `Issues/` directory.

If it does, figure out if we discovered anything new, and update the document. If not, just use the existing knowledge and we can resume debugging from there.

The markdown file should be named human readable something like: `ArgumentException - Already Added.md`

Don't write down unverified claims. Just facts that were analyzed.

**Format issues as follows:**

# Issue

## Description

Ask the user (me) to describe the problem they saw, and provide the logs. Take the description and the logs and summarize it in this section of the file.

## Resolution

Only add this section if I told you your solutions worked. It shall be after **Description** and before **Logs** section. But only if I told you we fixed it.

## Logs

If user has provided the logs, place the logs in this section.

## Analysis

After getting the info, perform a codebase analysis to see if the issue is related, and what you think the cause is.
